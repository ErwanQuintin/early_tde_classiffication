# early_tde_classiffication

Project containing the first steps on the TDE early photometric classification to be used within FINK, for ZTF and LSST data.
It includes the repositories ActsnClass and the fink_sn_activelearning modules as subtrees. They are slightly modified to be adapted to our use-case. We added the chisq measure, to be consistent with the data we have from Zenodo.
